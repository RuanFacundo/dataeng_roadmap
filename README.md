# **Data Engineering Roadmap**
A study path for Data Engineering. In this document, I will share websites, videos, courses, and newsletters that seem useful for the formation of a data engineer.

# **The Problem**
The problem for those who want to enter the field of data engineering is defining **what to study**. Specifically, **in what order** to study. There is an ocean of tools and techniques, and a tsunami of videos about them. Beginners get lost.

The intention of this document is to help reduce confusion. In the future, it can be a map to guide your studies. **But remember**: this is a suggestion based on my personal studies. Do not limit yourself to this list.
